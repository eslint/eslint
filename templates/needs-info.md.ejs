Hi @<%= payload.sender.login %>, thanks for the issue. It looks like there's not enough information for us to know how to help you. If you're reporting a bug, please be sure to include:

1. The version of ESLint you are using (run `eslint -v`)
2. What you did (the source code and ESLint configuration)
3. The actual ESLint output complete with numbers
4. What you expected to happen instead

Requesting a new rule? Please see [Proposing a New Rule](http://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/contributing/new-rules) for instructions.

If it's something else, please just provide as much additional information as possible. Thanks!
