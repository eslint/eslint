Thanks for the pull request, @<%= payload.sender.login %>! I took a look to make sure it's ready for merging and found some changes are needed:

<% problems.forEach(function(problem) { %>
* <%- problem %>
<% }); %>

Can you please edit the pull request title to address these?

  <summary>Why is this required?</summary>

  It's important that commit messages have a consistent format, because this allows us to use tooling to save time (e.g. autogenerating organized changelogs from commit messages). When a team member merges your pull request with GitHub's UI, the default commit message for the squashed commits is the title of the pull request. We want the title to have the correct format so that we can minimize errors when merging.
