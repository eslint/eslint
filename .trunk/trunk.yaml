          #  In order to successfully lint JavaScript files in the `docs` directory, dependencies declared in `docs/package.json`
          #  would have to be installed in `docs/node_modules`. In particular, eslint-plugin-node rules examine `docs/node_modules`
          #  when analyzing `require()` calls from CJS modules in the `docs` directory. Since our release process does not run `npm install`
          #  in the `docs` directory, linting would fail and break the release. Also, working on the main `eslint` package does not require
          #  installing dependencies declared in `docs/package.json`, so most contributors will not have `docs/node_modules` locally.
          #  Therefore, default check when running under LSP, monitor or cli will ignore "docs/**"
