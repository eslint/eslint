# Change Requests

If you'd like to request a change to ESLint, please [create a new issue](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/new?body=**What%20version%20are%20you%20using%3F**%0A%0A**What%20did%20you%20do%3F**%0A%0A**What%20happened%3F**%0A%0A**What%20did%20you%20expect%20to%20happen%3F**%0A%0A) on GitHub. Be sure to include the following information:

1. The version of ESLint you are using.
1. The problem you want to solve.
1. Your take on the correct solution to problem.

If you're requesting a change to a rule, it's helpful to include this information as well:

1. What you did.
1. What you would like to happen.
1. What actually happened.

Please include as much detail as possible to help us properly address your issue. If we need to triage issues and constantly ask people for more detail, that's time taken away from actually fixing issues. Help us be as efficient as possible by including a lot of detail in your issues.

**Note:** If you just have a question that won't necessarily result in a change to ESLint, such as asking how something works or how to contribute, please use the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/group/eslint) or [chat](https://gitter.im/eslint/eslint) instead of filing an issue.
