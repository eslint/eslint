This rule was **deprecated** in ESLint v7.0.0. Please use the corresponding rule in [`eslint-plugin-node`](https://github.com/mysticatea/eslint-plugin-node).

In Node.js, the behavior of the `Buffer` constructor is different depending on the type of its argument. Passing an argument from user input to `Buffer()` without validating its type can lead to security vulnerabilities such as remote memory disclosure and denial of service. As a result, the `Buffer` constructor has been deprecated and should not be used. Use the producer methods `Buffer.from`, `Buffer.alloc`, and `Buffer.allocUnsafe` instead.

## Rule Details

This rule disallows calling and constructing the `Buffer()` constructor.

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

::: incorrect

```js
new Buffer(5);
new Buffer([1, 2, 3]);

Buffer(5);
Buffer([1, 2, 3]);

new Buffer(res.body.amount);
new Buffer(res.body.values);
```

:::

Examples of **correct** code for this rule:

::: correct

```js
Buffer.alloc(5);
Buffer.allocUnsafe(5);
Buffer.from([1, 2, 3]);

Buffer.alloc(res.body.amount);
Buffer.from(res.body.values);
```

## When Not To Use It

If you don't use Node.js, or you still need to support versions of Node.js that lack methods like `Buffer.from`, then you should not enable this rule.
