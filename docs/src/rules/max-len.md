Very long lines of code in any language can be difficult to read. In order to aid in readability and maintainability many coders have developed a convention to limit lines of code to X number of characters (traditionally 80 characters).

```js
var foo = { "bar": "This is a bar.", "baz": { "qux": "This is a qux" }, "difficult": "to read" }; // very long
```

## Rule Details

This rule enforces a maximum line length to increase code readability and maintainability. The length of a line is defined as the number of Unicode characters in the line.

## Options

This rule has a number or object option:

* `"code"` (default `80`) enforces a maximum line length
* `"tabWidth"` (default `4`) specifies the character width for tab characters
* `"comments"` enforces a maximum line length for comments; defaults to value of `code`
* `"ignorePattern"` ignores lines matching a regular expression; can only match a single line and need to be double escaped when written in YAML or JSON
* `"ignoreComments": true` ignores all trailing comments and comments on their own line
* `"ignoreTrailingComments": true` ignores only trailing comments
* `"ignoreUrls": true` ignores lines that contain a URL
* `"ignoreStrings": true` ignores lines that contain a double-quoted or single-quoted string
* `"ignoreTemplateLiterals": true` ignores lines that contain a template literal
* `"ignoreRegExpLiterals": true` ignores lines that contain a RegExp literal
