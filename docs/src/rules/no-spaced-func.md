This rule was **deprecated** in ESLint v3.3.0 and replaced by the [func-call-spacing](func-call-spacing) rule.

While it's possible to have whitespace between the name of a function and the parentheses that execute it, such patterns tend to look more like errors.

## Rule Details

This rule disallows spacing between function identifiers and their applications.

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:
