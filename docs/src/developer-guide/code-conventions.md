Code conventions for ESLint are determined by
[eslint-config-eslint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-eslint).

The rationales for the specific rules in use can be found by looking to the
project documentation for any given rule. If the rule is one of our own, see
our own [rule documentation](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/) and otherwise, see
the documentation of the plugin in which the rule can be found.
