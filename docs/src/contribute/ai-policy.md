ESLint welcomes contributions from everyone, including those created with the assistance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools. We believe AI can be a powerful tool for improving software and want to encourage its responsible use in our project.

To ensure that AI contributions are integrated smoothly and maintain the quality of the codebase, we have established the following guidelines:

### Disclosure

If you use AI to generate an issue or a pull request, you must clearly disclose this in your submission. This helps maintainers understand the context of the contribution and perform appropriate reviews.

### Human Responsibility

While AI can help generate code or text, the responsibility for the contribution remains with the human submitter.

- **Review your work:** Before submitting a pull request generated by AI, you are expected to have thoroughly reviewed and tested the code yourself. Ensure it meets ESLint's coding standards and correctly addresses the issue.
- **Human responses:** When maintainers provide feedback or ask questions on your submission, we expect a human to respond. Please do not feed maintainer comments back into an AI to generate responses. We value human interaction and technical discussion.

### Pull Request Acceptance Criteria

To help manage the volume of contributions, we have a specific policy for AI-generated pull requests:

- **Accepted Issues Only:** AI-generated PRs will only be considered for issues that have been officially marked as "accepted" by the ESLint team.
- **Otherwise Closed:** AI-generated PRs submitted for issues that have not been marked as "accepted" will be closed without review.

We appreciate your cooperation in following these guidelines as we explore the benefits of AI-assisted development together!
