ESLint is officially dropping support for these versions of Node.js starting with ESLint v10.0.0. ESLint now supports the following versions of Node.js:

- Node.js v20.19.0 and above
- Node.js v22.13.0 and above
- Node.js v24 and above

**To address:** Make sure you upgrade to at least Node.js v20.19.0 when using ESLint v10. If you are unable to upgrade, we recommend continuing to use ESLint v9 until you are able to upgrade Node.js.
