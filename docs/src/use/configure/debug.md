ESLint creates a configuration for each file that is linted based on your configuration file and command line options. The larger the configuration file, the more difficult it can be to determine why a file isn't linted as expected. To aid in debugging your configuration, ESLint provides several tools.

## Run the CLI in Debug Mode

## Print a File's Calculated Configuration

## Use the Config Inspector
