## Configuration

## Legacy (eslintrc) Configuration

* [`ESLint couldn't determine the plugin … uniquely`](./couldnt-determine-the-plugin-uniquely)
* [`ESLint couldn't find the config … to extend from`](./couldnt-find-the-config)
* [`ESLint couldn't find the plugin …`](./couldnt-find-the-plugin)

Issues oftentimes can be resolved by updating the to latest versions of the `eslint` package and any related packages, such as for ESLint shareable configs and plugins.
