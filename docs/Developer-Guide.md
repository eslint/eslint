# Developer Guide

This guide is intended for those who wish to:

* Contribute code to ESLint
* Create their own rules for ESLint

In order to work with ESLint as a developer, it's recommended that:

* You know JavaScript, since ESLint is written in JavaScript.
* You have some familiarity with Node.js, since ESLint runs on it.
* You're comfortable with command-line programs.
* You understand unit tests and why they're important.

If that sounds like you, then continue reading to get started.

## Section 1: Get the [Source Code](Source-Code.md)

Before you can get started, you'll need to get a copy of the ESLint source code. This section explains how to do that and a little about the source code structure.

## Section 2: Setup a [Development-Environment](Development-Environment.md)

Developing for ESLint is a bit different than running it on the command line. This section shows you how to setup a development environment and get you ready to write code.

## Section 3: Run the [Unit Tests](Unit-Tests.md)

There are a lot of unit tests included with ESLint to make sure that we're keeping on top of code quality. This section explains how to run the unit tests.

## Section 4: [Working with Rules](Working-with-Rules.md)

You're finally ready to start working with rules. You may want to fix an existing rule or create a new one. This section explains how to do all of that.

## Section 5: [Contributing](Contributing.md)

Once you've made changes that you want to share with the community, the next step is to submit those changes back via a pull request.
