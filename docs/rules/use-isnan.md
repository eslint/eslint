In JavaScript, `NaN` is a special value of the `Number` type. It's used to represent any of the "not-a-number" values represented by the double-precision 64-bit format as specified by the IEEE Standard for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic. `NaN` has the unique property of not being equal to anything, including itself. That is to say, that the condition `NaN !== NaN` evaluates to true.
