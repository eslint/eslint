# require or disallow assignment operator shorthand where possible (operator-assignment)

(fixable) The `--fix` option on the [command line](../user-guide/command-line-interface#fix) automatically fixes problems reported by this rule.

JavaScript provides shorthand operators that combine variable assignment and some simple mathematical operations. For example, `x = x + 4` can be shortened to `x += 4`. The supported shorthand forms are as follows:

```text
 Shorthand | Separate
-----------|------------
 x += y    | x = x + y
 x -= y    | x = x - y
 x *= y    | x = x * y
 x /= y    | x = x / y
 x %= y    | x = x % y
 x <<= y   | x = x << y
 x >>= y   | x = x >> y
 x >>>= y  | x = x >>> y
 x &= y    | x = x & y
 x ^= y    | x = x ^ y
 x |= y    | x = x | y
```

## Rule Details

This rule requires or disallows assignment operator shorthand where possible.

## Options

This rule has a single string option:

* `"always"` (default)  requires assignment operator shorthand where possible
* `"never"` disallows assignment operator shorthand

### always

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule with the default `"always"` option:

```js
/*eslint operator-assignment: ["error", "always"]*/

x = x + y;
x = y * x;
x[0] = x[0] / y;
x.y = x.y << z;
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule with the default `"always"` option:

```js
/*eslint operator-assignment: ["error", "always"]*/

x = y;
x += y;
x = y * z;
x = (x * y) * z;
x[0] /= y;
x[foo()] = x[foo()] % 2;
x = y + x; // `+` is not always commutative (e.g. x = "abc")
```

### never

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule with the `"never"` option:

```js
/*eslint operator-assignment: ["error", "never"]*/

x *= y;
x ^= (y + z) / foo();
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule with the `"never"` option:

```js
/*eslint operator-assignment: ["error", "never"]*/

x = x + y;
x.y = x.y / a.b;
```

## When Not To Use It

Use of operator assignment shorthand is a stylistic choice. Leaving this rule turned off would allow developers to choose which style is more readable on a case-by-case basis.
