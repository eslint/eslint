# Disallow Labeled Statements (no-labels)

Labeled statements in JavaScript are used in conjunction with `break` and `continue` to control flow around multiple loops. For example:

```js
outer:
    while (true) {

        while (true) {
            break outer;
        }
    }
```

The `break outer` statement ensures that this code will not result in an infinite loop because control is returned to the next statement after the `outer` label was applied. If this statement was changed to be just `break`, control would flow back to the outer `while` statement and an infinite loop would result.

While convenient in some cases, labels tend to be used only rarely and are frowned upon by some as a remedial form of flow control that is more error prone and harder to understand.

## Rule Details

This rule aims to eliminate the use of labeled statements in JavaScript. It will warn whenever a labeled statement is encountered and whenever `break` or `continue` are used with a label.

The following patterns are considered problems:

```js
/*eslint no-labels: 2*/

label:                   /*error Unexpected labeled statement.*/
    while(true) {
        // ...
    }

label:                   /*error Unexpected labeled statement.*/
    while(true) {
        break label;     /*error Unexpected label in break statement.*/
    }

label:                  /*error Unexpected labeled statement.*/
    while(true) {
        continue label; /*error Unexpected label in continue statement.*/
    }
```

The following patterns are not considered problems:

```js
/*eslint no-labels: 2*/

var f = {
    label: "foo"
};

while (true) {
    break;
}

while (true) {
    continue;
}
```

## When Not To Use It

If you need to use labeled statements, then you can safely disable this rule.
