# Disallow Duplicate Keys (no-dupe-keys)

Creating objects with duplicate keys in objects can cause unexpected behavior in your application. The `no-dupe-keys` rule flags the use of duplicate keys in object literals.

```js
var foo = {
    bar: "baz",
    bar: "qux"
};
```

## Rule Details

This rule is aimed at preventing possible errors and unexpected behavior that might arise from using duplicate keys in object literals. As such, it warns whenever it finds a duplicate key.

The following patterns are considered warnings:

```js
/*eslint no-dupe-keys: 2*/

var foo = {
    bar: "baz",
    bar: "qux"     /*error Duplicate key 'bar'.*/
};

var foo = {
    "bar": "baz",
    bar: "qux"     /*error Duplicate key 'bar'.*/
};

var foo = {
    0x1: "baz",
    1: "qux"       /*error Duplicate key '1'.*/
};
```

The following patterns are considered okay and do not cause warnings:

```js
/*eslint no-dupe-keys: 2*/

var foo = {
    bar: "baz",
    quxx: "qux"
};
```
