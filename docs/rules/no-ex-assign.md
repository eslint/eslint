# Disallow Assignment of the Exception Parameter (no-ex-assign)

When an error is caught using a `catch` block, it's possible to accidentally (or purposely) overwrite the reference to the error. Such as:

```js
try {
    // code
} catch (e) {
    e = 10;
}
```

This makes it impossible to track the error from that point on.


## Rule Details

This rule's purpose is to enforce convention. Assigning a value to the exception parameter wipes out all the valuable data contained therein and thus should be avoided. Since there is no `arguments` object to offer alternative access to this data, assignment of the parameter is absolutely destructive.

The following patterns are considered problems:

```js
/*eslint no-ex-assign: 2*/

try {
    // code
} catch (e) {
    e = 10;
}
```

The following patterns are not considered problems:

```js
/*eslint no-ex-assign: 2*/

try {
    // code
} catch (e) {
    var foo = 'bar';
}
```

## Notes

Related aside: there are some interesting caveats in IE 6-8 where the exception identifier will leak into the outer scope causing some unexpected behavior. Ben Alman has a [great article](http://weblog.bocoup.com/the-catch-with-try-catch/) that explains this behavior in detail
