# Rules

Rules in ESLint are divided into several categories to help you better understand their value. Additionally, not all rules are enabled by default. Those that are not enabled by default are marked as being off.

## Legacy

The following rules are included for compatibility with [JSHint](http://jshint.com/) and [JSLint](http://jslint.com/). While the names of the rules may not match up with the JSHint/JSLint counterpart, the functionality is the same.

* [max-depth](max-depth.md) - specify the maximum depth that blocks can be nested (off by default)
