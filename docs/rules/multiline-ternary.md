# Enforce or disallow newlines between operands of ternary expressions (multiline-ternary)

JavaScript allows operands of ternary expressions to be separated by newlines, which can improve the readability of your program.

For example:

```js
var foo = bar > baz ? value1 : value2;
```

The above can be rewritten as the following to improve readability and more clearly delineate the operands:

```js
var foo = bar > baz ?
    value1 :
    value2;
```

## Rule Details

This rule enforces or disallows newlines between operands of a ternary expression.
Note: The location of the operators is not enforced by this rule. Please see the [operator-linebreak](operator-linebreak.md) rule if you are interested in enforcing the location of the operators themselves.

## Options

This rule has a string option:

* `"always"` (default) enforces newlines between the operands of a ternary expression.
* `"never"` disallows newlines between the operands of a ternary expression (enforcing that the entire ternary expression is on one line).

### always

This is the default option.

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule with the `"always"` option:

```js
/*eslint multiline-ternary: ["error", "always"]*/

foo > bar ? value1 : value2;

foo > bar ? value :
    value2;

foo > bar ?
    value : value2;
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule with the `"always"` option:

```js
/*eslint multiline-ternary: ["error", "always"]*/

foo > bar ?
    value1 :
    value2;

foo > bar ?
    (baz > qux ?
        value1 :
        value2) :
    value3;
```

### never

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule with the `"never"` option:

```js
/*eslint multiline-ternary: ["error", "never"]*/

foo > bar ? value :
    value2;

foo > bar ?
    value : value2;

foo >
    bar ?
    value1 :
    value2;
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule with the `"never"` option:

```js
/*eslint multiline-ternary: ["error", "never"]*/

foo > bar ? value1 : value2;

foo > bar ? (baz > qux ? value1 : value2) : value3;
```

## When Not To Use It

You can safely disable this rule if you do not have any strict conventions about whether the operands of a ternary expression should be separated by newlines.
