# Enforce empty lines around comments (lines-around-comment)

Many style guides require empty lines before or after comments. The primary goal
of these rules is to make the comments easier to read and improve readability of the code.

## Rule Details

This rule allows you to specify whether an empty line should be found
before or after a comment. It can be enabled separately for both block (`/*`)
and line (`//`) comments, and does not apply to comments that appear on the same
line as code.


By default an empty line is required above a block comment,
such as in the following example:

```js
var x = 0;

/**
 * The vertical position.
 */
var y = 10;
```

The following would *not* pass the rule:

```js
var x = 0;
/* the vertical position */
var y = 10;
```

### Inline comments

Inline comments are always excluded from the rule.

The following would be acceptable:

```js
/*eslint lines-around-comment: 2*/

var x = 0;
var y = 10; /* the vertical position */
```

Empty lines are also not required at the beginning or end of a file.

## Options

This rule has 10 options.

2 options for block comments:

* `beforeBlockComment` (enabled by default)
* `afterBlockComment`

2 options for line comments:

* `beforeLineComment`
* `afterLineComment`

6 options for exceptions:

* `allowBlockStart`
* `allowBlockEnd`
* `allowObjectStart`
* `allowObjectEnd`
* `allowArrayStart`
* `allowArrayEnd`

Any combination of these rules may be applied at the same time.


```json
{
    "lines-around-comment": [2, { "beforeBlockComment": true, "beforeLineComment": true }]
}
```

When set to `false` the option is simply ignored.


### Block Comments

Block comments are any comment that start with `/*` and need not extend to multiple lines.

With both `beforeBlockComment` and `afterBlockComment` set to `true` the following code
would not warn:

```js
/*eslint lines-around-comment: [2, { "beforeBlockComment": true, "afterBlockComment": true }]*/

var night = "long";

/* what a great and wonderful day */

var day = "great"
```

This however would provide 2 warnings:

```js
/*eslint lines-around-comment: [2, { "beforeBlockComment": true, "afterBlockComment": true }]*/

var night = "long";
/* what a great and wonderful day */  /*error Expected line before comment.*/ /*error Expected line after comment.*/
var day = "great"
```

With only `beforeBlockComment` set to `true` the following code
would not warn:

```js
/*eslint lines-around-comment: [2, { "beforeBlockComment": true }]*/

var night = "long";

/* what a great and wonderful day */
var day = "great"
```

But this would cause 1 warning:

```js
/*eslint lines-around-comment: [2, { "beforeBlockComment": true }]*/

var night = "long";
/* what a great and wonderful day */     /*error Expected line before comment.*/
var day = "great"
```

### Line Comments

Line comments are any comments that start with `//`.

With both `beforeLineComment` and `afterLineComment` set to `true` the following code
would not warn:

```js
/*eslint lines-around-comment: [2, { "beforeLineComment": true, "afterLineComment": true }]*/

var night = "long";

// what a great and wonderful day

var day = "great"
```

With only `beforeLineComment` set to `true` the following code
would not warn:

```js
/*eslint lines-around-comment: [2, { "beforeLineComment": true }]*/

var night = "long";

// what a great and wonderful day
var day = "great"
```

### `allowBlockStart`

When this option is set to `true`, it allows the comment to be present at the start of any block statement without any space above it. This option can be useful when combined with options `beforeLineComment` and `beforeBlockComment` only.

With both `beforeLineComment` and `allowBlockStart` set to `true` the following code
would not warn:

```js
/*eslint lines-around-comment: [2, { "beforeLineComment": true, "allowBlockStart": true }]*/

function foo(){
    // what a great and wonderful day
    var day = "great"
    return day;
}
```

With both `beforeBlockComment` and `allowBlockStart` set to `true` the following code
would not warn:

```js
/*eslint lines-around-comment: [2, { "beforeBlockComment": true, "allowBlockStart": true }]*/

function foo(){
    /* what a great and wonderful day */
    var day = "great"
    return day;
}
```

### `allowBlockEnd`

When this option is set to `true`, it allows the comment to be present at the end of any block statement without any space below it. This option can be useful when combined with options `afterLineComment` and `afterBlockComment` only.

With both `afterLineComment` and `allowBlockEnd` set to `true` the following code
would not warn:

```js
/*eslint lines-around-comment: [2, { "afterLineComment": true, "allowBlockEnd": true }]*/

function foo(){
    var day = "great"
    return day;
    // what a great and wonderful day
}
```

With both `afterBlockComment` and `allowBlockEnd` set to `true` the following code
would not warn:

```js
/*eslint lines-around-comment: [2, { "afterBlockComment": true, "allowBlockEnd": true }]*/

function foo(){
    var day = "great"
    return day;

    /* what a great and wonderful day */
}
```

### `allowObjectStart`

When this option is set to `true`, it allows the comment to be present at the start of any object-like statement without any space above it. This option can be useful when combined with options `beforeLineComment` and `beforeBlockComment` only.

With both `beforeLineComment` and `allowObjectStart` set to `true` the following code
would not warn:

```js
/*eslint lines-around-comment: [2, { "beforeLineComment": true, "allowObjectStart": true }]*/

var foo = {
    // what a great and wonderful day
    day: "great"
};

const {
    // what a great and wonderful day
    foo: someDay
} = {foo: "great"};

const {
    // what a great and wonderful day
    day
} = {day: "great"};
```

With both `beforeBlockComment` and `allowObjectStart` set to `true` the following code
would not warn:

```js
/*eslint lines-around-comment: [2, { "beforeBlockComment": true, "allowObjectStart": true }]*/

var foo = {
    /* what a great and wonderful day */
    day: "great"
};

const {
    /* what a great and wonderful day */
    foo: someDay
} = {foo: "great"};

const {
    /* what a great and wonderful day */
    day
} = {day: "great"};
```

### `allowObjectEnd`

When this option is set to `true`, it allows the comment to be present at the end of any object-like statement without any space below it. This option can be useful when combined with options `afterLineComment` and `afterBlockComment` only.

With both `afterLineComment` and `allowObjectEnd` set to `true` the following code
would not warn:

```js
/*eslint lines-around-comment: [2, { "afterLineComment": true, "allowObjectEnd": true }]*/

var foo = {
    day: "great"
    // what a great and wonderful day
};

const {
    foo: someDay
    // what a great and wonderful day
} = {foo: "great"};

const {
    day
    // what a great and wonderful day
} = {day: "great"};
```

With both `afterBlockComment` and `allowObjectEnd` set to `true` the following code
would not warn:

```js
/*eslint lines-around-comment: [2, { "afterBlockComment": true, "allowObjectEnd": true }]*/

var foo = {
    day: "great"

    /* what a great and wonderful day */
};

const {
    foo: someDay

    /* what a great and wonderful day */
} = {foo: "great"};

const {
    day

    /* what a great and wonderful day */
} = {day: "great"};
```

### `allowArrayStart`

When this option is set to `true`, it allows the comment to be present at the start of any array-like statement without any space above it. This option can be useful when combined with options `beforeLineComment` and `beforeBlockComment` only.

With both `beforeLineComment` and `allowArrayStart` set to `true` the following code
would not warn:

```js
/*eslint lines-around-comment: [2, { "beforeLineComment": true, "allowArrayStart": true }]*/

var day = [
    // what a great and wonderful day
    "great",
    "wonderful"
];

const [
    // what a great and wonderful day
    someDay
] = ["great", "not great"];
```

With both `beforeBlockComment` and `allowArrayStart` set to `true` the following code
would not warn:

```js
/*eslint lines-around-comment: [2, { "beforeBlockComment": true, "allowArrayStart": true }]*/

var day = [
    /* what a great and wonderful day */
    "great",
    "wonderful"
];

const [
    /* what a great and wonderful day */
    someDay
] = ["great", "not great"];
```

### `allowArrayEnd`

When this option is set to `true`, it allows the comment to be present at the end of any array-like statement without any space below it. This option can be useful when combined with options `afterLineComment` and `afterBlockComment` only.

With both `afterLineComment` and `allowArrayEnd` set to `true` the following code
would not warn:

```js
/*eslint lines-around-comment: [2, { "afterLineComment": true, "allowArrayEnd": true }]*/

var day = [
    "great",
    "wonderful"
    // what a great and wonderful day
];

const [
    someDay
    // what a great and wonderful day
] = ["great", "not great"];
```

With both `afterBlockComment` and `allowArrayEnd` set to `true` the following code
would not warn:

```js
/*eslint lines-around-comment: [2, { "afterBlockComment": true, "allowArrayEnd": true }]*/

var day = [
    "great",
    "wonderful"

    /* what a great and wonderful day */
];

const [
    someDay

    /* what a great and wonderful day */
] = ["great", "not great"];
```

## When Not To Use It

Many people enjoy a terser code style and don't mind comments bumping up against code. If you
fall into that category this rule is not for you.
