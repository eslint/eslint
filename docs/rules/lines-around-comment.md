# Enforce empty lines around comments (lines-around-comment)

Many style guides require empty lines before or after comments. The primary goal
of these rules is to make the comments easier to read and improve readability of the code.

## Rule Details

This rule allows you to specify whether an empty line should be found
before or after a comment. It can be enabled separately for both block (`/*`)
and line (`//`) comments, and does not apply to comments that appear on the same
line as code.


By default an empty line is required above a block comment,
such as in the following example:

```js
var x = 0;

/**
 * The vertical position.
 */
var y = 10;
```

The following would *not* pass the rule:

```js
var x = 0;
/* the vertical position */
var y = 10;
```

### Options

This rule has 4 options:

1. `beforeBlockComment` (enabled by default)
2. `afterBlockComment`
3. `beforeLineComment`
4. `afterLineComment`

Any combination of these rules may be applied at the same time.


```json
{
    "lines-around-comment": [2, { beforeBlockComment: true, beforeLineComment: true }]
}
```

When set to `false` the option is simply ignored.


#### Block Comments

Block comments are any comment that start with `/*` and need not extend to multiple lines.

With both `beforeBlockComment` and `afterBlockComment` set to `true` the following code
would not warn:

```js
var night = "long";

/* what a great and wonderful day */

var day = "great"
```

This however would provide 2 warnings:

```js
var night = "long";
/* what a great and wonderful day */
var day = "great"
```

With only `beforeBlockComment` set to `true` the following code
would not warn:

```js
var night = "long";

/* what a great and wonderful day */
var day = "great"
```

But this would cause 1 warning:

```js
var night = "long";
/* what a great and wonderful day */
var day = "great"
```

#### Line Comments

Line comments are any comments that start with `//`.

With both `beforeLineComment` and `afterLineComment` set to `true` the following code
would not warn:

```js
var night = "long";

// what a great and wonderful day

var day = "great"
```

With only `beforeLineComment` set to `true` the following code
would not warn:

```js
var night = "long";

// what a great and wonderful day
var day = "great"
```

### Exceptions

Inline comments are always excluded from the rule.

The following would be acceptable:

```js
var x = 0;
var y = 10; /* the vertical position */
```

Empty lines are also not required at the beginning or end of a file.

## When Not To Use It

Many people enjoy a terser code style and don't mind comments bumping up against code. If you
fall into that category this rule is not for you.
