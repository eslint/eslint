# Enforces spacing around commas (comma-spacing)

Spacing around commas improve readability of a list of items. Although most of the style guidelines for languages prescribe adding a space after a comma and not before it, it is subjective to the preferences of a project.

```js
var foo = 1, bar = 2;
var foo = 1 ,bar = 2;
```

## Rule Details

This rule aims to enforce spacing around a comma. As such, it warns whenever it sees a missing or unwanted space in commas of variable declaration, object property, function parameter, sequence and array element.


### Options

The rule takes one option, an object, which has two keys `before` and `after` having boolean values `true` or `false`. If `before` is `true`, space is enforced before commas and if it's `false`, space is disallowed before commas. If `after` is `true`, space is enforced after commas and if it's `false`, space is disallowed after commas. The default is `{"before": false, "after": true}`.

```json
    "comma-spacing": [2, {"before": false, "after": true}]
```

The following examples show two primary usages of this option.

#### {"before": false, "after": true}

This is the default option. It enforces spacing after commas and disallows spacing before commas.

The following patterns are considered warnings:

```js

    var foo = 1 ,bar = 2;
    var arr = [1 , 2];
    var obj = {"foo": "bar" ,"baz": "qur"};
    foo(a ,b);
    new Foo(a ,b);
    function foo(a ,b){}
    a ,b
```

The following patterns are not warnings:

```js

    var foo = 1, bar = 2;
    var arr = [1, 2];
    var obj = {"foo": "bar", "baz": "qur"};
    foo(a, b);
    new Foo(a, b);
    function foo(a, b){}
    a, b
```

#### {"before": true, "after": false}

This option enforces spacing before commas and disallows spacing after commas.

The following patterns are considered warnings:

```js

    var foo = 1, bar = 2;
    var arr = [1 , 2];
    var obj = {"foo": "bar", "baz": "qur"};
    new Foo(a,b);
    function foo(a,b){}
    a, b
```

The following patterns are not warnings:

```js

    var foo = 1 ,bar = 2;
    var arr = [1 ,2];
    var obj = {"foo": "bar" ,"baz": "qur"};
    foo(a ,b);
    new Foo(a ,b);
    function foo(a ,b){}
    a ,b
```

## When Not To Use It

If your project will not be following a consistent comma-spacing pattern, turn this rule off.
