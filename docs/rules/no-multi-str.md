# Disallow Multiline Strings (no-multi-str)

It's possible to create multiline strings in JavaScript by using a slash before a newline, such as:

```js
var x = "Line 1 \
         Line 2";
```

Some consider this to be a bad practice as it was an undocumented feature of JavaScript that was only formalized later.

## Rule Details

This rule is aimed at preventing the use of multiline strings.

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

```js
/*eslint no-multi-str: "error"*/
var x = "Line 1 \
         Line 2";
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule:

```js
/*eslint no-multi-str: "error"*/

var x = "Line 1\n" +
        "Line 2";
```
