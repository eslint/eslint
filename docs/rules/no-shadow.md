# Disallow Shadowing (no-shadow)

Shadowing is the process by which a local variable shares the same name as a variable in its containing scope. For example:

```js
var a = 3;
function b() {
    var a = 10;
}
```

In this case, the variable `a` inside of `b()` is shadowing the variable `a` in the global scope. This can cause confusion while reading the code and it's impossible to access the global variable.

## Rule Details

This rule aims to eliminate shadowed variable declarations.

The following patterns are considered warnings:

```js
var a = 3;
function b() {
    var a = 10;
}
```

```js
var a = 3;
var b = function () {
    var a = 10;
}
```

```js
var a = 3;
function b(a) {
    a = 10;
}
b(a);
```
