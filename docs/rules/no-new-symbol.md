# Disallow Symbol Constructor (no-new-symbol)

The `Symbol` constructor is not intended to be used with the `new` operator, but to be called as a function.

```js
var foo = new Symbol("foo");
```

This throws a `TypeError` exception.

## Rule Details

This rule is aimed at preventing the accidental calling of `Symbol` with the `new` operator.

The following patterns are considered problems:

```js
/*eslint no-new-symbol: 2*/
/*eslint-env es6*/

var foo = new Symbol('foo');                    /*error `Symbol` cannot be called as a constructor. */
```

The following patterns are not considered problems:

```js
/*eslint no-new-symbol: 2*/
/*eslint-env es6*/

var foo = Symbol('foo');


// Ignores shadowed Symbol.
function bar(Symbol) {
    const baz = new Symbol("baz");
}

```

## When Not To Use It

This rule should not be used in ES3/5 environments.
