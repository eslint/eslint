# Quoting Style for Property Names (quote-props)

Object literal property names can be defined in two ways: using literals or using strings. For example, these two objects are equivalent:

```js
var object1 = {
    property: true;
};

var object2 = {
    "property": true
};
```

In many cases, it doesn't matter if you choose to use an identifier instead of a string or vice-versa. There are, however, some occasions when you must use quotes:

1. If you are using an ECMAScript 3 JavaScript engine (such as IE8) and you want to use a keyword (such as `if`) as a property name. This restriction was removed in ECMAScript 5.
2. You want to use a non-identifier character in your property name, such as having a property with a space like `"one two"`.

Sometimes the choice to use quotes is purely stylistic and sometimes it's functional. Here's another example:

```js
var object = {
    1e2: 1,
    100: 2
};
```

This may look alright at first sight, but this code in fact throws a syntax error in ECMAScript 5 strict mode. This happens because `1e2` and `100` are coerced into strings before getting used as the property name. Both `String(1e2)` and `String(100)` happen to be equal to `"100"`, which causes the "Duplicate data property in object literal not allowed in strict mode" error. Issues like that can be tricky to debug, so some prefer to require quotes around all property names.

## Rule Details

This rule aims to enforce use of quotes in property names and as such will flag any properties that don't use quotes.

### Options

There are two behaviors for this rule: `"always"` (default) and `"as-needed"`. You can define these options in your configuration as:

```json
{
    "quote-props": [2, "as-needed"]
}
```

When configured with `"always"` as the first option (the default), quoting for all properties will be enforced. Some believe that ensuring property names in object literals are always wrapped in quotes is generally a good idea, since [depending on the property name you may need to quote them anyway](https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/javascript-properties). Consider this example:

```js
var object = {
    foo: "bar",
    baz: 42,
    "qux-lorem": true
};
```

Here, the properties `foo` and `baz` are not wrapped in quotes, but `qux-lorem` is, because it doesnâ€™t work without the quotes. This is rather inconsistent. Instead, you may prefer to quote property names consistently:

```js
var object = {
    "foo": "bar",
    "baz": 42,
    "qux-lorem": true
};
```

or, if you prefer single quotes:

```js
var object = {
    'foo': 'bar',
    'baz': 42,
    'qux-lorem': true
};
```

When configured with `"always"` (the default), the following patterns are considered warnings:

```js
var object = {
    foo: "bar",
    baz: 42,
    "qux-lorem": true
};
```

The following patterns are considered okay and do not cause warnings:

```js
var object1 = {
    "foo": "bar",
    "baz": 42,
    "qux-lorem": true
};

var object2 = {
    'foo': 'bar',
    'baz': 42,
    'qux-lorem': true
};

var object3 = {
    foo() {
        return;
    }
};
```

When configured with `"as-needed"` as the first option (the default), the following patterns are considered warnings:

```js
var object = {
    "a": 0,
    "0": 0,
    "true": 0,
    "null": 0
};
```

The following patterns are considered okay and do not cause warnings:

```js
var object1 = {
    "a-b": 0,
    "0x0": 0
};

var object2 = {
    foo: 'bar',
    baz: 42,
    'qux-lorem': true
};

var object3 = {
    foo() {
        return;
    }
};
```

## When Not To Use It

If you don't care if property names are consistently wrapped in quotes or not, turn this rule off.
