# Require braces in arrow function body (arrow-body-style)

Arrow functions have two syntactic forms for their function bodies.  They may be defined with a *block* body (denoted by curly braces) `() => { ... }` or with a single expression `() => ...`, whose value is implicitly returned.

## Rule Details

This rule can enforce or disallow the use of braces around arrow function body.

## Options

The rule takes one option, a string, which can be:

* `"always"` enforces braces around the function body
* `"as-needed"` enforces no braces where they can be omitted (default)
* `"never"` enforces no braces around the function body (constrains arrow functions to the role of returning an expression)

### "always"

```json
"arrow-body-style": ["error", "always"]
```

When the rule is set to `"always"` the following patterns are considered problems:

```js
/*eslint arrow-body-style: ["error", "always"]*/
/*eslint-env es6*/
let foo = () => 0;
```

The following patterns are not considered problems:

```js
let foo = () => {
    return 0;
};
let foo = (retv, name) => {
    retv[name] = true;
    return retv;
};
```

### "as-needed"

When the rule is set to `"as-needed"` the following patterns are considered problems:

```js
/*eslint arrow-body-style: ["error", "as-needed"]*/
/*eslint-env es6*/

let foo = () => {
    return 0;
};
let foo = () => {
    return {
       bar: {
            foo: 1,
            bar: 2,
        }
    };
};
```

The following patterns are not considered problems:

```js
/*eslint arrow-body-style: ["error", "as-needed"]*/
/*eslint-env es6*/

let foo = () => 0;
let foo = (retv, name) => {
    retv[name] = true;
    return retv;
};
let foo = () => ({
    bar: {
        foo: 1,
        bar: 2,
    }
});
let foo = () => { bar(); };
let foo = () => {};
let foo = () => { /* do nothing */ };
let foo = () => {
    // do nothing.
};
```

### "never"

When the rule is set to `"never"` the following patterns are considered problems:

```js
/*eslint arrow-body-style: ["error", "never"]*/
/*eslint-env es6*/

let foo = () => {
    return 0;
};
let foo = (retv, name) => {
    retv[name] = true;
    return retv;
};
```

The following patterns are not considered problems:

```js
/*eslint arrow-body-style: ["error", "never"]*/
/*eslint-env es6*/

let foo = () => 0;
let foo = () => ({ foo: 0 });
```
