# Disallow Early Use (no-use-before-define)

Since variable and function declarations are hoisted to the top of a scope, it's possible to use identifiers before their formal declarations in code. This can be confusing and some believe it is best to always declare variables and functions before using them.

It takes an optional option as the second parameter which can be `"nofunc"` to allow named function definitions to be used before the location where they are defined.

```js
alert(a);

var a = 10;
```

## Rule Details

This rule will warn when it encounters a reference to an identifier that has not been declared as part of a `var` or function statement.

The following patterns are considered warnings:

```js
alert(a);
var a = 10;

f();
function f() {}
```

The following patterns are not considered warnings when `"nofunc"` is specified:

```js
f();
function f() {}
```

The following patterns are not considered warnings:

```js
var a = 10; alert(a);

function f() {} f();
```

The `"nofunc-noclass"` option does for Classes the same that `"nofunc"` does for functions. Not only
all of the patterns above are considered OK, but also the following pattern is not considered warning:

```js
var a = new A();

class A{}
```
