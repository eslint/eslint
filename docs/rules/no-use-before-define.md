# Disallow Early Use (no-use-before-define)

In JavaScript, prior to ES6, variable and function declarations are hoisted to the top of a scope, so it's possible to use identifiers before their formal declarations in code. This can be confusing and some believe it is best to always declare variables and functions before using them.

In ES6, block-level bindings (`let` and `const`) introduce a "temporal dead zone" where a `ReferenceError` will be thrown with any attempt to access the variable before its declaration.

## Rule Details

This rule will warn when it encounters a reference to an identifier that has not been yet declared.

The following patterns are considered problems:

```js
/*eslint no-use-before-define: 2*/
/*eslint-env es6*/

alert(a);
var a = 10;

f();
function f() {}

function g() {
    return b;
}
var b = 1;

// With blockBindings: true
{
    alert(c);
    let c = 1;
}
```

The following patterns are not considered problems:

```js
/*eslint no-use-before-define: 2*/
/*eslint-env es6*/

var a;
a = 10;
alert(a);

function f() {}
f(1);

var b = 1;
function g() {
    return b;
}

// With blockBindings: true
{
    let C;
    c++;
}
```

## Options

```json
{
    "no-use-before-define": [2, {"functions": true, "classes": true}]
}
```

* `functions` (`boolean`) -
  The flag which shows whether or not this rule checks function declarations.
  If this is `true`, this rule warns every reference to a function before the function declaration.
  Otherwise, ignores those references.
  Function declarations are hoisted, so it's safe.
  Default is `true`.
* `classes` (`boolean`) -
  The flag which shows whether or not this rule checks class declarations of upper scopes.
  If this is `true`, this rule warns every reference to a class before the class declaration.
  Otherwise, ignores those references if the declaration is in upper function scopes.
  Class declarations are not hoisted, so it might be danger.
  Default is `true`.

This rule accepts `"nofunc"` string as a option.
`"nofunc"` is the same as `{"functions": false, "classes": true}`.

The following patterns are not considered problems when `"functions": false` is specified:

```js
/*eslint no-use-before-define: [2, {functions: false}]*/

f();
function f() {}
```

The following patterns are not considered problems when `"classes": false` is specified:

```js
/*eslint no-use-before-define: [2, {classes: false}]*/

function foo() {
    return new A();
}

class A {
}
```

The following patterns are considered problems when `"classes": false` is specified:

```js
/*eslint no-use-before-define: [2, {classes: false}]*/

new A();
class A {
}
```
