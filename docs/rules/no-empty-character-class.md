# Disallow Empty Character Classes (no-empty-character-class)

Empty character classes in regular expressions do not match anything and can result in code that may not work as intended.

```js
var foo = /^abc[]/;
```

## Rule Details

This rule is aimed at highlighting possible typos and unexpected behavior in regular expressions which may arise from the use of empty character classes.

The following patterns are considered problems:

```js
/*eslint no-empty-character-class: 2*/

var foo = /^abc[]/;

/^abc[]/.test(foo);

bar.match(/^abc[]/);
```

The following patterns are not considered problems:

```js
/*eslint no-empty-character-class: 2*/

var foo = /^abc/;

var foo = /^abc[a-z]/;

var bar = new RegExp("^abc[]");
```
