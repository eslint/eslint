# No with Statements (no-with)

The `with` statement is potentially problematic because it adds members of an object to the current scope, making it impossible to tell what a variable inside the block actually refers to. Additionally, the `with` statement cannot be used in strict mode.

## Rule Details

This rule is aimed at eliminating `with` statements.

The following patterns are considered problems:

```js
/*eslint no-with: 2*/
with (foo) {
    // ...
}
```

## When Not To Use It

If you intentionally use `with` statements then you can disable this rule.
