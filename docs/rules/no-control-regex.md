# Disallow Controls Characters in Regular Expressions (no-control-regex)

Control characters are special, invisible characters in the ASCII range 0-31. These characters are rarely used in JavaScript strings so a regular expression containing these characters is most likely a mistake.

## Rule Details

This rule is aimed at ensuring all regular expressions don't use control characters.


The following patterns are considered problems:

```js
/*eslint no-control-regex: 2*/

var pattern1 = /\\x1f/;
var pattern2 = new RegExp("\x1f");
```

The following patterns do not cause a warning:

```js
/*eslint no-control-regex: 2*/

var pattern1 = /\\x20/;
var pattern2 = new RegExp("\x20");
```

## When Not To Use It

If you need to use control character pattern matching, then you should turn this rule off.
