# Require Dot Notation (dot-notation)

In JavaScript, one can access properties using the dot notation (`foo.bar`) or square-bracket notation (`foo["bar"]`). However, the dot notation is often preferred because it is easier to read, less verbose, and works better with aggressive JavaScript minimizers.

```js
foo["bar"];
```

## Rule Details

This rule is aimed at maintaining code consistency and improving code readability by encouraging use of the dot notation style whenever possible. As such, it will warn when it encounters an unnecessary use of square-bracket notation.

The following patterns are considered warnings:

```js
var x = foo["bar"];
```

The following patterns are not considered warnings:

```js
var x = foo.bar;

var x = foo[bar];    // Property name is a variable, square-bracket notation required
```

Set the `allowKeywords` option to `false` (default is `true`) to follow ECMAScript version 3 compatible style, avoiding dot notation for reserved word properties.

```
  "dot-notation": [2, {"allowKeywords": false}],
```

```js
var foo = { "class": "CS 101" }
var x = foo["class"]; // Property name is a reserved word, square-bracket notation required
```
