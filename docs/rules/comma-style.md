# Comma style (comma-style)

The Comma Style rule enforces styles for comma-separated lists. There are two comma styles primarily used in JavaScript:

* The standard style, in which commas are placed at the end of the current line
* Comma First style, in which commas are placed at the start of the next line

One of the justifications for using Comma First style is that it can help track missing and trailing commas. These are problematic because missing commas in variable declarations can lead to the leakage of global variables and trailing commas can lead to errors in older versions of IE.

## Rule Details

This rule enforce consistent comma style in array literals, object literals, and variable declarations.

This rule does not apply in either of the following cases:

* comma preceded and followed by linebreak (lone comma)
* single-line array literals, object literals, and variable declarations

## Options

This rule has a string option:

* `"last"` (default) requires a comma after and on the same line as an array element, object property, or variable declaration
* `"first"` requires a comma before and on the same line as an array element, object property, or variable declaration

This rule also accepts an additional `exceptions` object:

* `"exceptions"` has properties whose names correspond to node types in the abstract syntax tree (AST) of JavaScript code:

    * `"ArrayExpression": true` ignores comma style in array literals
    * `"ObjectExpression": true` ignores comma style in object literals
    * `"VariableDeclaration": true` ignores comma style in variable declarations

A way to determine the node types as defined by [ESTree](https://github.com/estree/estree) is to use the [online demo](http://eslint.org/parser).

### last

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule with the default `"last"` option:

```js
/*eslint comma-style: ["error", "last"]*/

var foo = 1
,
bar = 2;

var foo = 1
  , bar = 2;

var foo = ["apples"
           , "oranges"];

function bar() {
    return {
        "a": 1
        ,"b:": 2
    };
}
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule with the default `"last"` option:

```js
/*eslint comma-style: ["error", "last"]*/

var foo = 1, bar = 2;

var foo = 1,
    bar = 2;

var foo = ["apples",
           "oranges"];

function bar() {
    return {
        "a": 1,
        "b:": 2
    };
}
```

### first

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule with the `"first"` option:

```js
/*eslint comma-style: ["error", "first"]*/

var foo = 1,
    bar = 2;

var foo = ["apples",
           "oranges"];

function bar() {
    return {
        "a": 1,
        "b:": 2
    };
}
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule with the `"first"` option:

```js
/*eslint comma-style: ["error", "first"]*/

var foo = 1, bar = 2;

var foo = 1
    ,bar = 2;

var foo = ["apples"
          ,"oranges"];

function bar() {
    return {
        "a": 1
        ,"b:": 2
    };
}
```

### exceptions

An example use case is to enforce comma style *only* in var statements.

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule with sample `"first", { "exceptions": { … } }` options:

```js
/*eslint comma-style: ["error", "first", { "exceptions": { "ArrayExpression": true, "ObjectExpression": true } }]*/

var o = {},
    a = [];
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule with sample `"first", { "exceptions": { … } }` options:

```js
/*eslint comma-style: ["error", "first", { "exceptions": { "ArrayExpression": true, "ObjectExpression": true } }]*/

var o = {fst:1,
         snd: [1,
               2]}
  , a = [];
```

## When Not To Use It

This rule can safely be turned off if your project does not care about enforcing a consistent comma style.
