# Disallow Variables Deletion (no-delete-var)

This rule prevents the use of `delete` operator on variables:

```js
/*eslint no-delete-var: 2*/

var x;
delete x;
```

The delete operator will only delete the properties of objects. It cannot "delete" variables or anything else. Using them on variables might lead to unexpected behavior.
