# Require Spaces Around Infix Operators (space-infix-ops)

While formatting preferences are very personal, a number of style guides require spaces around operators, such as:

```js
var sum = 1 + 2;
```

The proponents of these extra spaces believe it make the code easier to read and can more easily highlight potential errors, such as:

```js
var sum = i+++2;
```

While this is valid JavaScript syntax, it is hard to determine what the author intended.

## Rule Details
