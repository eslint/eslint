ESLint couldn't determine the plugin "{{= it.pluginId }}" uniquely.
{{ for (const { filePath, importerName } of it.plugins) { }}
- {{= filePath }} (loaded in "{{= importerName }}"){{ } }}

Please remove the "plugins" setting from either config or remove either plugin installation.

If you still can't figure out the problem, please stop by https://eslint.org/chat/help to chat with the team.
