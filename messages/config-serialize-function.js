    This typically happens when you're using a custom parser that does not
provide a "meta" property, which is how ESLint determines the serialized

The requested operation requires ESLint to serialize configuration data,
but the configuration key "${objectKey}.${key}" contains a function value,
which cannot be serialized.

}

If you still have problems, please stop by https://eslint.org/chat/help to chat
with the team.
