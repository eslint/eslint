ESLint couldn't find the plugin "{{= it.pluginName }}".

(The package "{{= it.pluginName }}" was not found when loaded as a Node module from the directory "{{= it.resolvePluginsRelativeTo }}".)

It's likely that the plugin isn't installed correctly. Try reinstalling by running the following:

    npm install {{= it.pluginName }}@latest --save-dev

The plugin "{{= it.pluginName }}" was referenced from the config file in "{{= it.importerName }}".

If you still can't figure out the problem, please stop by https://eslint.org/chat/help to chat with the team.
