"{{= it.configName }}" is invalid syntax for a config specifier.

* If your intention is to extend from a configuration exported from the plugin, add the configuration name after a slash: e.g. "{{= it.configName }}/myConfig".
* If this is the name of a shareable config instead of a plugin, remove the "plugin:" prefix: i.e. "{{= it.configName.slice("plugin:".length) }}".

"{{= it.configName }}" was referenced from the config file in "{{= it.importerName }}".
